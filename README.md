**Gufi is a script created to speed up the test of routers security with wps 
activated,is based on older pixiedust attack,that is present today on new and
old wifi routers around the global.**

**In my research,i discover that the routers with ralink and realtek chipsets with
wps activated still vulnerable to this attack on most cases,cracking the key in 
seconds depending on wifi signal or how close are you to the router.**

**dependencies:**

aircrack-ng,
python2,
reaver,

**this script was maked and tested on debian strech**


**installation:**

There a lots of tutorials on how to install all dependencies in your favorite
linux distro on the net,if you have kali or parrot os just clone the script
and fireup:

<b>python gufi</b>
